## Features

### Views

**Full view** (default)
Every element in the network is shown simultaneously, arranged in concentric rings by constitutional distance from the Prime Minister:
- Ring 0 — Prime Minister
- Ring 1 — Cabinet Ministers
- Ring 2 — Junior Ministers
- Ring 3 — Ministerial and Non-Ministerial Departments
- Ring 4 — Executive Agencies and Divisions/Directorates
- Ring 5+ — All other bodies, placed by BFS distance from the nearest ring-1–4 node

Hover any node to reveal its name in a cursor-following tooltip and highlight its full ancestor chain plus direct children. Click a node to select it — the selected element is highlighted with an amber border and its name is shown as a persistent label. Click on the background to clear the selection. The ↺ button re-centres on the PM and clears the selection.

When the search or jurisdiction filter is active in full view, matching elements are highlighted across the whole network and connections between them are shown, making it easy to see where a filtered set of organisations sits in the network.

**Focus view**
The selected element is placed at the centre with its parents, grandparents, children, and grandchildren arranged radially. Click any node to re-focus the chart. The ↺ button resets the layout.

**Dark / light mode**
Toggle between light and dark appearances via the ☾/☀ button in the chart toolbar (desktop) or the moon/sun icon in the mobile navigation bar.

### Navigation & Visualization
- **Interactive network graph** — click any node to select it; connections arranged radially in focus view
- **Element pane** — detailed sidebar with tabbed sections for Info, Powers, Budget, and Staff
- **Random element** — ⚄ button (top-right of chart) jumps to a randomly selected element from the entire database
- **Legend** — ☰ Legend button toggles the key on desktop; shown by default, hidden on mobile. Groups section only shown in focus view
- **Jurisdiction filter** — 🌍 Territory button filters the chart by geographic scope (UK, England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Crown Dependencies, Overseas Territories); selecting a territory shows all elements whose remit covers it, including broader jurisdictions; reset with ↺
- **Category pane** — click any category badge to see a description and full list of all elements of that type
- **Tag pane** — click any tag pill to see all organisations sharing that tag
- **Search pane** — full-text and tag-based search across all elements; in full view, results are highlighted live on the network with connections between matches shown
- **Help pane** — in-app guide accessible via the Help button
- **Categories pane** — browse all element types grouped by section
- **Mobile selection chip** — on mobile, tapping a node shows a name/type bar at the bottom; tap **Select** to update the chart, then **Details →** to open the full pane

### Element Detail Tabs

Each element's detail pane has up to four tabs:

**Info**
- Description, role title, current role holder
- Jurisdiction (where set — e.g. England, England & Wales, UK)
- Clickable tag pills (type and sector)
- All parent and child relationships, grouped by relationship type and clickable to navigate
- Link to GOV.UK page

**Powers**
- Powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities listed as cards, filterable by type
- Each entry shows the power type, date in force, and one or more legislative sources
- Sources link directly to [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk) where available
- Data entered for all Cabinet ministers, the PM, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, and other key officials

**Budget**
- 2024–25 final outturn spending from HM Treasury OSCAR data
- Headline figures: net expenditure, gross expenditure, income
- DEL / AME split shown as a proportional bar
- Spending breakdown with three views: By Type, By Programme, By Body
- Donut charts with hover tooltips; clicking a body slice navigates to that element
- Budget data available for 37 department groups

**Staff**
- Civil Service headcount as at 31 March 2025
- Grade breakdown (SCS, Grade 6/7, SEO/HEO, EO, AA/AO)
- For departments, a toggle switches between grade view and by-organisation view
- Clicking a sub-organisation row navigates to that element

### Classification System

| Category | Subtypes |
|----------|----------|
| Official | Prime Minister, Cabinet Minister, Junior Minister, Civil Servant, Independent Official |
| Department | Ministerial Department, Non-Ministerial Department, Executive Agency, Division / Directorate |
| Body | Executive NDPB, Advisory NDPB, Public Corporation, Royal Charter Body, Tribunal, Other Body |
| Group | Cabinet, Other Group |

### Tag System

Each element can carry **type tags** (e.g. Regulator, Museum / Gallery, Armed Forces) and **sector tags** (e.g. Health, Finance, Digital / Technology). Tags are colour-coded, clickable in the element pane, and filterable in the search pane. In full view, tag filters highlight the matching elements across the entire network.

### Jurisdiction System

Departments and bodies carry a `jurisdictions` field indicating the geographic scope of their remit. The hierarchy is:

```
UK
├── GB (England, Scotland, Wales)
│   ├── England & Wales
│   │   ├── England
│   │   └── Wales
│   └── Scotland
└── Northern Ireland

Crown Dependencies  (Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man — separate)
Overseas Territories  (British Overseas Territories — separate)
```

Filtering by a territory shows all elements whose remit covers it — e.g. filtering for England shows UK-wide, GB, England & Wales, and England-only bodies. Elements with no jurisdiction set default to UK-wide.

## Data Structures

### GovElement (`src/data/elements.ts`)

```typescript
{
  id: string                   // unique identifier (kebab-case)
  name: string                 // display name
  category: 'official' | 'department' | 'body' | 'group'
  subtype: string              // see classification system above
  description: string
  role?: string                // role title (officials only)
  currentHolder?: string       // person currently in the role
  infoUrl?: string             // link to GOV.UK page
  parentIds: string[]          // elements this reports to / is part of
  secondaryParentIds?: string[] // additional oversight relationships (e.g. junior minister → dept)
  tags?: string[]              // tag IDs from tagDefinitions
  jurisdictions?: Jurisdiction[] // geographic scope; omitted = UK-wide by default
}
```

Reverse lookups are computed at module load time:
- `getChildIds(id)` — elements that list `id` in their `parentIds`
- `getSecondaryChildIds(id)` — elements that list `id` in their `secondaryParentIds`
- `getConnectedElements(id)` — returns `{ parents, children, secondaryParents, secondaryChildren }`

### PowerProfile (`src/data/powers.ts`)

```typescript
{
  elementId: string
  lastReviewed?: string
  powers: Array<{
    id: string
    title: string
    description: string
    powerType: 'power' | 'duty' | 'function' | 'responsibility'
    inForceFrom?: string
    sources: Array<{
      type: 'act' | 'statutory-instrument' | 'prerogative' | 'case-law' | 'convention'
      title: string
      section?: string
      year?: number
      legislationUrl?: string
      caseRef?: string
    }>
    notes?: string
  }>
}
```

### BudgetProfile and StaffProfile

See the existing `budgets.ts` and `staffing.ts` type definitions. Use `getStaffProfile(elementId)` — it searches both top-level profiles and sub-organisation arrays so agencies can be looked up without duplicating data.
